Today the class was at 2pm. And sr taught  us regarding the regression that how much it is useful for getting the most accurate result. Also we learn about that classification and regression are the two most important part of Machine Learning algorithm. Reading it I felt that really its too good to laern about such topics to have a better understanding of the Machine Learning from the roots. We can also evaluate the model using the score method, which for regressors returns the R 2 score. The R 2 score, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a measure of goodness of a prediction for a regression model, and yields a score between 0 and 1. A value of corresponds to a perfect prediction, and a value of 0 corresponds to a constant model that just predicts the mean of the training set responses, y_train :
